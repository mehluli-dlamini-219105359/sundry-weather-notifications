As the sole person working on the Sundry Weather Notifications project, I face significant challenges in prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile processes with the product’s goals. 
These include relying on my own judgment for task prioritization , designing UI/UX without bias to what I would like as an individual, which can be difficult. Without the experience or input of a team, I may over- or underestimate the time and effort needed for certain tasks, leading to delays or rushed work.
I am challenged to create and establish priority tasks which will meet requirements as well as producing a quality artefact. Breaking down the work into manageable tasks and focusing on delivering small increments ensures the team can consistently address high-priority features and test hypotheses about the product’s value with minimal resources, 
progressively refining the product.
