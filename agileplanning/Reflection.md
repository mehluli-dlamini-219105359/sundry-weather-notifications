# üå¶Ô∏è Reflection
As the sole stakeholder working on the Sundry Weather Notifications project, I face significant challenges in prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile processes with the product‚Äôs goals. 
These include relying on my own judgment for task prioritization , designing UI/UX without bias to what I would like as an individual, which can be difficult. Without the experience or input of a team, I may over- or underestimate the time and effort needed for certain tasks, leading to delays or rushed work.
I am challenged to create and establish priority tasks which will meet requirements as well as producing a quality artefact. Breaking down the work into manageable tasks and focusing on delivering small increments ensures the team can consistently address high-priority features and test hypotheses about the product‚Äôs value with minimal resources, 
progressively refining the product.

Lastly, aligning Agile processes [Agile Manifesto - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto) with stakeholder needs is challenging. In a team environment, stakeholder feedback shapes the product‚Äôs direction. As the sole stakeholder, a lack of external validation makes it harder to ensure the product will meet real-world demands, increasing the risk of prioritising tasks and an artefact that doesn‚Äôt fully serve its intended users and not meeting real world demands.
