Created a Kanban Board called **Assignment 6 Kanban Board** to manage a two-week sprint plan.  
**Sprint MVP / Goal:** Deliver the core authentication and account creation/registration functionalities to enable a seamless login onboarding experience.

**Task 1 : User Story Creation**

Each task consists of different componest such as design , developing and implementation. The current plan once this sprint has been completed is to start testing , this is intended as the staggered approach by having development a week or two ahead creates a sizeable backlog for QA team where as in the same sprint it would delay new items being taken up.
