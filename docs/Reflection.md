**UML Diagram:** A challenge faced was ensuring the UML diagrams displayed properly as the actors and arrows weren’t as clear in the diagram as expected. 
Another challenge was narrowing down the use cases and actors while keeping everything aligned with the original requirements—fitting in new roles and removing unneeded ones. 
This resulted in learning how to find balance and flexibility while and making sure each use case is well-defined while keeping the stakeholders in mind.

**Test cases:** Organizing and structuring detailed test cases, both functional and non-functional, required focusing on creating them based on original specifications while ensuring that each test case was concise yet comprehensive. 
Navigating through multiple tables and ensuring clarity and adding the non-functional test cases. Test cases should be matter of fact and not ambigous.
