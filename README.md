The **Sundry Notification Web App** is a project that will focus on proximity based push notifications for weather events in Cape Town , such as high winds and fires. 
I undertook or chose this project based on the role that awareness or early warning systems can play to improve alertness towards climate and weather events on the road for commuters. 
Alertness while driving and being a passenger in a private or public vehicle improves the likelihood of less accidents. Highwinds can cause vehicles to swerve into other lanes while fires can cause 
less visibilty for both drivers and padestrians on the very same roads. These weather events are common occurrences in Cape Town and have caused accidents along the N1 and N2 highways. 
The arrive alive campaign in South Africa has helped create public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving , this awareness project through a simple Notification can possible create more 
alert drivers and contribute to safer and much intentional driving practices. Small nudges through a cellular device can impossible alter behaviour or attitude as we use these devices daily.
