## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

* Use strong typing wherever possible.
* Encapsulate logic in classes under `src/models`.
* Separate concerns (e.g., `factories`, `repositories`, `services`, etc.)

### Linting & Formatting

* **(Optional)** Add ESLint and Prettier in the future.
* Stick to clear, readable naming conventions.
* Prefer composition over inheritance unless it adds clarity.

### Testing

* Use **Jest** for all tests (`tests/unit`).
* Every new class or method should include a corresponding unit test.
* Run `npm run test:unit` before submitting a PR.
