The challenges faced were around finding a way to implement the system without compromising performance and user experience. 
The interaction between the database, API, and the delivery of push notifications must be somewhat flawless, with no room for subpar performance. 
This requires careful planning from stakeholders responsible for these areas, along with collaboration from the Test Analyst 
and Product Manager to ensure quality and consistency across the system. Upon more investigation it is important that a product manager should maintain clear communication with the development team to ensure that the product is growing in the right direction.
All members of the team follow rules within their role but ultimately the cleint experience in terms of usability , delivery of notifications (speed) and reliabity (chosen open api) are metrics that can be 
used to measure how application is useful and weather they can retain the users.
