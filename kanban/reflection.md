# ☀️ Reflection

1. **Selecting the Template**: Initially, I needed to choose a template that suited the specific needs of my Agile development process. Since I am working alone, I needed a template that will be simple and effective for tracking progress and organizing tasks. The challenge was finding a balance between a board that was too simplistic (which might miss key stages) and one that was too complex (which could overcomplicate the process).
Ultimately, I customized a standard Kanban board to fit my needs, keeping it straightforward but detailed enough to cover the workflow stages like **Sprint Backlog**, **To Do**, **In Progress**, **In Review/Testing**, **Done** and **Won't Do**.

3. **Customizing the Template**: Once I selected the base template, I had to customize it to match my exact workflow. The challenge here was ensuring that the board’s columns reflected the specific phases of my development cycle. For instance, adding the **In Review/Testing** column was necessary to ensure a dedicated space for quality assurance without rushing tasks to completion.
I also needed to adjust the layout and labels to ensure clarity and simplicity. Too many columns or unclear labels could have led to confusion or a lack of focus.

5. **Ensuring Usability**: Another challenge I faced was making sure the board was not just functional but also easy to use. Since I’m managing the project alone, I made sure that moving tasks from one column to the next was intuitive and required minimal effort while keeping the number of tasks each column can accomodate low.
Finding a balance between structure and flexibility was tricky, as I needed to avoid restricting my workflow while ensuring the board stayed organized.

7. **Visual Representation and Clarity**: I had to ensure that the images were clear and accurately reflected the board’s content.
I made sure the images were high-quality and the board layout was easy to read, avoiding visual clutter. Integrating these images into my documentation required careful planning to maintain flow and ensure the visuals added value instead of making the board look overloaded and being true to where the project is currently.
Development and Testing have not started it would be disingenuous of me to add items in those columns.

9. **Staying Focused on Key Agile Principles**: Finally, I needed to ensure the Kanban board aligned with **Agile principles**—particularly **visualizing work**, **limiting work-in-progress**, and ensuring **continuous delivery**.
