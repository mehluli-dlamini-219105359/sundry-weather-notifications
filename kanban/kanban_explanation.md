## Kanban Explanation

A **Kanban board** is a workflow management tracking tool to assess the progress of tasks in a specific project. It is used to 
support continous delivery , implementation and iterations of features made by a team with different roles and responsibilities.
This board will focus on items that are specific to the login feature **(Sundry Weather Notifications)** of the project to better align with focus and order of priority.

**NB** : I have created a custom view for this board which better alings with adding custom columns **(To-do , In progress , Review|Testing & Done)**. The reason for a Sprint Backlog column is to also highlight which user stories will be used and broken down into tasks for the purpose of showing which items are in which status. Each column (excluding Sprint Backlog) can take up to 3 items to better support focus and priority , Design is the only item to be in Progress and taken up in this sprint/iteration.
**NB** : Additional Views of Kanban Board can be found in [Agile Planning Document](https://github.com/mehluli-dlamini-219105359/sundry-weather-notifications/blob/main/agileplanning/AgilePlanningDocument.md)

## How My Board Supports Agile Workflows

### 1. Visualizing Task Workflow
My **Kanban board**, named **"Assignment 6 Kanban Board"**, is structured into **columns representing task progress**. [Custom Kanban Board View](https://github.com/users/mehluli-dlamini-219105359/projects/1/views/9)

**Customisation Choices** 
Custom columns (Sprint Backlog and Won't do)

Columns as stages to the workflow, such as:
- **To Do** – Backlogged tasks that need to be worked on. - **Maximum of 3 Items**
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on. - **Maximum of 3 Items**
- **Review/Testing** – Completed tasks awaiting validation.- **Maximum of 3 Items** 
- **Done** – Successfully completed tasks. - **No Limit**
- **Won't Do** - Items that will not be done in sprint or feature is scrapped.

- This streamlined setup limits distractions, encourages focus on one task at a time, and improves team collaboration (or, in this case, individual accountability) by providing a clear, visual representation of the work that needs to be done. This promotes a higher level of efficiency and ensures steady progress throughout the sprint.

### Tasks and Labels
All items (tasks) are assigned to me , as the sole contributor / stakeholder of this assignment and filtered by query to represent priority of board items.

### 2. Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
To prevent overload and maintain efficiency, I implement **WIP limits** on columns such as **“In Progress”** and **“Review/Testing.”**
- By capping the number of active tasks at a time, I ensure **focus** on completing current work before starting new ones.
- This prevents bottlenecks where too many tasks pile up in a single stage, slowing down overall progress.

### 3. Supporting Agile Principles
- **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks are broken into **small, functional increments** that contribute directly to the sprint goal. This ensures that value is delivered regularly.
- **Adaptability:** The board allows for **dynamic reprioritization**, making it easy to adjust the backlog as priorities shift.
- **Transparency & Collaboration:** Even as the sole stakeholder, the board provides **self-accountability**, ensuring a clear understanding of sprint progress and deadlines.
