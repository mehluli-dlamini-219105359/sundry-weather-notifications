## Kanban Explanation

A **Kanban board** is a workflow management tracking tool to assess the progress of tasks in a specific project. It is used to 
support continous delivery , implementation and iterations of features made by a team with different roles and responsibilities.
This board will focus on items that are specific to the login feature **(Sundry Weather Notifications)** of the project to better align with focus and order of priority.

## How My Board Supports Agile Workflows

### 1. Visualizing Task Workflow
My **Kanban board**, named **"Assignment 6 Kanban Board"**, is structured into **columns representing task progress**. [Custom Kanban Board View](https://github.com/users/mehluli-dlamini-219105359/projects/1/views/9)

Each column corresponds to a different stage in the workflow, such as:
- **To Do** – Backlogged tasks that need to be worked on. - **Maximum of 3 Items**
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on. - **Maximum of 3 Items**
- **Review/Testing** – Completed tasks awaiting validation.- **Maximum of 3 Items** 
- **Done** – Successfully completed tasks. - **No Limit** 

This visualization provides a clear **real-time snapshot** of the work status, ensuring transparency in the sprint.

### 2. Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
To prevent overload and maintain efficiency, I implement **WIP limits** on columns such as **“In Progress”** and **“Review/Testing.”**
- By capping the number of active tasks at a time, I ensure **focus** on completing current work before starting new ones.
- This prevents bottlenecks where too many tasks pile up in a single stage, slowing down overall progress.

### 3. Supporting Agile Principles
- **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks are broken into **small, functional increments** that contribute directly to the sprint goal. This ensures that value is delivered regularly.
- **Adaptability:** The board allows for **dynamic reprioritization**, making it easy to adjust the backlog as priorities shift.
- **Transparency & Collaboration:** Even as the sole stakeholder, the board provides **self-accountability**, ensuring a clear understanding of sprint progress and deadlines.
